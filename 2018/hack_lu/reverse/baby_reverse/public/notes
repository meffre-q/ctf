Hey there, future Reverser!

We created this small challenge to introduce you to reversing. This task might _still_ take quite some time, but trust us, it will be very rewarding!
We sadly can't spoonfeed you, but we created a set of questions which you might want to answer yourself. We expect you to google on your own and find resources.

Sooo, lets get started!

- What kind of binary have you got infront of you? (Hint: "file" command)
- How can you disassemble the file? (objdump, gdb, radare...)
- Which programs are common debuggers?
- How can I use them? (we recommend gdb with the peda plugin)
- - how can I set breakpoints?
- - in which different ways can I step through programs?
- - how can I print/examine the content of memory/addresses
- what is inside registers? what's rax, rip, rsp?
- what is the linux syscall convention?
- - In which register is the second argument?
- - In which register is the syscall number?
- - - where can I find the syscall numbers on my own linux system?
- what happens at a call instruction?
- how can I compare strings in assembly?
- .. ask your teammates for more! annoy them if anything is unclear :P
- .. if you don't got any teammates, use IRC and say that it's about the baby challenge

There is a lot of work ahead of you, and maybe some sleepless nights with a lot of googling - but it will be worth it;-)!
We are certain that with a dedicated mind you can solve this task and from there on you'll be ready for a bright future!
Don't give up, we all have been there. Stick to it and you'll be rewarded =)
